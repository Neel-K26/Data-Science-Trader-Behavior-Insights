## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores how trader profitability, risk, volume, and leverage align or diverge from market sentiment (Fear vs Greed).  

Completed as part of the **Web3 Trading Team â€“ Data Science Assignment**.  

**Datasets analyzed:**  
1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset** â€“ daily sentiment classification (`Fear` / `Greed`) and index values.  
2. **Historical Trader Data (Hyperliquid)** â€“ trade-level data (`execution price`, `size`, `side`, `closedPnL`, `leverage`, etc.).  

The analysis includes daily aggregation, feature engineering, visualizations, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling using Random Forests.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](YOUR_COLAB_NOTEBOOK_LINK)  
   - Ensure the runtime has access to your **Google Drive**.  
   - Place datasets inside: `MyDrive/Dataset Folder/`  

2. Run all notebook cells sequentially to reproduce results:  
   - Aggregate data by date  
   - Merge with sentiment index  
   - Generate engineered features  
   - Produce visualizations & perform hypothesis testing  
   - Train a Random Forest classifier  

3. All outputs (plots, CSVs) are saved automatically in the `outputs/` folder.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results
- **Hypothesis Testing**: No significant difference in PnL between Fear vs Greed days.  
- **Random Forest Model Performance**:  
  - Accuracy: ~75%  
  - ROC-AUC: ~0.69  
  - High recall for profitable days (~91%)  
- **Feature Importance**: PnL Volatility, Rolling Avg PnL, and Trading Volume were most predictive.  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights
- Sentiment alone is **not sufficient** for predicting profitability.  
- Combining sentiment with volatility & trading activity metrics improves predictive power.  
- Fear/Greed influences **trading intensity** more than profitability.  

---

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements
- Incorporate microstructure features (order book depth, intra-day volatility clusters).  
- Explore sequential models (LSTMs, Transformers) for temporal patterns.  
- Extend dataset timeframe to identify more robust trends.
